there are a lot of bugs.
i tried my best to make it user friendly but still a lot of issuses are there. (lazy)
Try to follow the instructions carefuly, because program is not user friendly, a small mistake could result in a fatal bug
if u encounter any bugs then delete all the files then reinstall.

the program starts the class at the time u give when u create the timetable
so if u have a class at 9:00 and load that timetable at 9:01 the program will not start the class at 9:00 becuse the time to start the class has passed
always load the timetable at least 2 mintues before ur classes

if u get the screen shown in issue its became ur emial has 2 factor verfication that doesnt allow bots to access it
